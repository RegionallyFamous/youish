Paste messy notes. Get sharp prose that still sounds like you. That should not be controversial. Apparently we needed a tool anyway.

Dittobot turns rough drafts, notes, and rants into clear writing without sanding off the parts that sound like you. It is not AI trying to borrow a soul. It is an editor protecting the one already in the draft.

## What Dittobot Is

Dittobot is a Codex skill that edits from your source instead of inventing a new voice. It finds the point, protects facts and uncertainty, keeps useful rough edges, and cuts bland AI tells.

It is not a ghostwriter. It is a voice-preserving editor: your claims, your taste, your stance, your rhythm, just cleaned up enough that the reader does not have to excavate the point with a tiny shovel.

It also checks the reader's job. The clean version should make the point, stakes, limits, and next action clear after one pass.

For hard work, it expands into a silent 20-pass editorial loop. For proof, the repo ships a 100-case regression suite, model-free rewrite audits, privacy-first failure fixtures, compact voice profiles, fact fences, and public release scorecards.

Normal use is still simple: paste the mess and get the clean version.

Voice-faithful means something testable here:

- It preserves claims, stance, uncertainty, rhythm, distinctive phrases, and reader action.
- It refuses unsupported facts, invented brands, fake certainty, extra jokes, and generic polish that says less.
- It proves those promises with deterministic fixtures, mutation checks, package validation, and release scorecards.

## The Point

The answer is not "let AI write for you." The answer is "teach the tool your voice."

This started because I watched a real critique turn into a dumb rule. People saw verbose, generic, dash-happy AI writing and jumped straight to "nobody should use AI for writing." I get the rage. Bad AI writing is padded, fake-confident, weirdly bloodless, and somehow proud of saying almost nothing.

I agreed with the diagnosis and hated the prescription.

Banning AI because bad AI writing exists treats the worst workflow as the only workflow. That is a very confident way to lose the plot.

If your AI writes badly, the answer is not to throw away the tool. The answer is to teach it taste.

## Watch It Work

### Stream Of Consciousness

Source:

```text
ok the launch note is somehow both too long and says nothing. what i actually mean is we fixed the importer bug, people can retry failed rows now, and i need it to sound calm but not like a haunted changelog
```

What survives/changes:

- The facts are "importer bug fixed" and "failed rows can be retried."
- The voice marker worth keeping is "haunted changelog."

Rewrite:

```text
We fixed the importer bug. Failed rows can now be retried, so the note can stay calm and useful instead of turning into a haunted changelog.
```

### Generic AI Paste

Source:

```text
In today's rapidly evolving landscape, our robust platform empowers teams to unlock seamless collaboration and drive meaningful impact.
```

What survives/changes:

- The sentence sounds confident but says almost nothing.
- Inventing specifics would make it worse.

Rewrite:

```text
This draft sounds confident but does not say enough to rewrite safely. Add what changed, who it helps, and what people can do now.
```

### Voice Worth Keeping

Source:

```text
This draft is not bad. It just walks into the room and immediately apologizes for existing.
```

What survives/changes:

- The image is the point.
- A smoother rewrite would be worse.

Rewrite:

```text
The draft is not bad. It just walks into the room and immediately apologizes for existing. The idea works; the framing is getting in its way.
```

### Precision-Sensitive Writing

Source:

```text
I think we probably need to send notice within 10 business days, but I am not counsel and the clause had weird carveouts.
```

What survives/changes:

- "Probably," "I think," and "not counsel" are precision, not clutter.
- The rewrite must not turn uncertainty into legal certainty.

Rewrite:

```text
I think we may need to send notice within 10 business days. I would not state that as definitive, though, because I am not counsel and the clause had unusual carveouts.
```

### Mixed Human Stance

Source:

```text
I am a little angry that people saw bad AI writing and decided the answer was banning the tool, but I am also genuinely excited because we can teach it taste instead of pretending pencils are holy now.
```

What survives/changes:

- The anger and hope both matter.
- The rewrite should be sharp without turning into a personal attack.

Rewrite:

```text
I am annoyed that people saw bad AI writing and decided the answer was banning the tool. But I am also genuinely excited, because we can teach it taste instead of pretending pencils are holy now.
```

## What Skeptics Are Right About

The AI-writing backlash has receipts. People have seen enough soulless, padded, fake-confident slop to be annoyed. Good. Stay annoyed. Just aim the annoyance at the workflow instead of pretending the tool has only one possible setting.

- **"It sounds like nobody."** Correct, if you ask it to invent a voice. Dittobot starts from your words. The stance, rhythm, humor, pressure, and weird little phrase are already there.
- **"It gets bloated."** Bad AI writes like it is being paid by the clause. Dittobot cuts filler and returns the rewrite without a lecture unless you ask for one.
- **"It flattens everyone into the same house style."** Yes, if everyone accepts the first generic draft. Dittobot keeps dry jokes, justified edge, warmth, awkwardness, and useful rough edges.
- **"It invents confidence."** That is a real failure mode. Dittobot does not add numbers, customers, citations, examples, legal certainty, or convenient details that were not in the source.
- **"It hides who wrote it."** Editing is not the same as outsourcing authorship. Dittobot keeps your claims, taste, and decisions in charge.
- **"The tells give it away."** Dashes are not the crime. Predictability is. Dittobot can obey no-dash rules, but the deeper fix is cadence and taste.

The problem is not using AI. The problem is accepting the first bland answer, then blaming the whole category because nobody steered.

So the behavior is deliberately boring where bad AI gets cute:

- If the draft has no facts, Dittobot will not invent facts.
- If the draft has uncertainty, Dittobot keeps the uncertainty.
- If the draft has a weird good phrase, Dittobot protects it.
- If the draft is bloated, Dittobot cuts before it decorates.
- If a constraint says no dashes, no notes, or exactly 40 words, Dittobot treats that like the job.

## When Not To Use It

Dittobot needs source text or a real voice sample. It is not for making up legal, medical, financial, academic, or factual certainty. It should not bypass publication policies, disclosure rules, or common sense around private data.

When disclosure matters, say the true thing: edited with AI from my draft, grammar and clarity assistance only, or AI-assisted line edit with facts checked by me. Authorship is not a magic spell. Be honest about the workflow and keep responsibility where it belongs.

| Good For | Not For |
|---|---|
| Emails, posts, notes, announcements, bios, captions, messy drafts, and half-formed thoughts | Inventing facts, citations, customers, legal certainty, medical certainty, or financial advice |
| Making a real draft cleaner, sharper, shorter, warmer, stranger, or more readable | Hiding authorship, bypassing disclosure rules, or pretending nobody edited anything |
| Preserving a personal, team, or publication voice | Replacing judgment, policy, review, or the writer's responsibility |

## Use It

First, install Dittobot from inside Codex:

```text
Use $skill-installer to install Dittobot from GitHub repo RegionallyFamous/dittobot. Use path "." and install it as "dittobot".
```

That `.` means the root Dittobot skill in the GitHub repo. You do not need to clone anything.

Then start a new Codex session and paste the mess. Most prompts should be this boring:

```text
Use $dittobot on this:

[paste the messy draft, notes, rant, email, announcement, post, caption, or half-formed thought]
```

That is the point. Drop in the stream of consciousness; get back the version that sounds like you after sleep, coffee, and one more pass.

Choose one install path:

| Path | Use When |
|---|---|
| Codex prompt | You want the streamlined Codex skill install. |
| Terminal fallback | `$skill-installer` is unavailable and you are comfortable with Terminal. |
| Pinned GitHub CLI | You want an explicit tagged skill install through `gh`. |
| Codex plugin source | You want Dittobot as a Codex plugin package. |
| Open skills CLI | You use skill-aware agents or ecosystems that support the shared `skills` installer. |

Codex prompt:

```text
Use $skill-installer to install Dittobot from GitHub repo RegionallyFamous/dittobot. Use path "." and install it as "dittobot".
```

Terminal fallback:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RegionallyFamous/dittobot/v0.2.6/install.sh | DITTOBOT_REF=v0.2.6 bash
```

Pinned GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh skill install RegionallyFamous/dittobot skills/dittobot --agent codex --scope user --pin v0.2.6
```

Codex plugin source:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add RegionallyFamous/dittobot --ref v0.2.6
codex plugin add dittobot@dittobot
```

Open skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add RegionallyFamous/dittobot
```

The plugin command means: install the plugin named `dittobot` from the marketplace source named `dittobot`. For normal skill use, the Codex prompt path is the one to use.

The open skills CLI path is for skill-aware agents and ecosystems that use the shared `skills` installer. For Codex, use the Codex prompt path first.

The terminal fallback requires `curl`, `tar`, and Python 3. It installs a copy, backs up an existing Dittobot install, verifies itself, and does not use `sudo`.

Uploadable assets live in [Releases](https://github.com/RegionallyFamous/dittobot/releases): skill ZIP, plugin ZIP, public scorecard, and checksums.

Most of the time, the default prompt is enough. Add instructions only for hard constraints like exact word count, no dashes, a specific audience, options, diagnosis-only mode, or a request to show what changed.

## Proof, Not Vibes

Dittobot's quality story is not "trust me, it feels good." The repo checks voice preservation, protected facts, uncertainty, claim fidelity, exact word counts, no-dash constraints, and anti-generic behavior.

The tests check the boring things that matter in real writing: did it keep the facts, keep the voice marker, avoid fake certainty, obey the constraint, and return something useful?

This does not prove literary taste. It proves Dittobot keeps the constraints it claims to protect: facts, uncertainty, length, format, and anti-generic behavior.

| Promise | How It Is Tested |
|---|---|
| Keep the user's voice | Voice marker fixtures, profile contracts, and mutation tests that remove keeper phrases |
| Preserve facts and claims | Protected fact checks, required claims, forbidden assertions, numeric drift checks |
| Preserve uncertainty | Legal and technical cases that fail if "maybe" becomes false certainty |
| Refuse invented details | Unsupported detail markers, invented numbers, and unsupported entity detection |
| Avoid generic AI polish | Buzzword checks plus pattern tests for shiny but empty phrasing |
| Respect constraints | Exact word count, no-dash, format, wrapper, and paragraph-shape checks |
| Turn notes into usable text | Source-only thought-dump cases with artifact cleanup and reader-action checks |

The scorecard is intentionally boring: complete-suite gates, stable failure codes, hashes, package checks, marketplace checks, and public-safe reporting.

Taste up front. Receipts in the back.

## Research Thread

The critique is worth taking seriously. Research on human-AI co-writing has found that writers care about preserving authentic voice, and other work has found AI suggestions can flatten writing toward dominant styles. Dittobot is a practical answer to that risk: keep the speed, reject the flattening.

- ["It was 80% me, 20% AI": Seeking Authenticity in Co-Writing with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13032): authenticity depends on writers feeling the final piece still carries their choices.
- [AI Suggestions Homogenize Writing Toward Western Styles and Diminish Cultural Nuances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11360): suggestion systems can flatten voice, so voice preservation has to be a first-class requirement.
- [Digital.gov: Principles of plain language](https://digital.gov/guides/plain-language/principles): write for the audience, make the useful action clear, and cut clutter.
- [CPSC: Plain Language Principles](https://www.cpsc.gov/About-CPSC/Policies-Statements-and-Directives/plain-language-principles): plain writing is not dumbed-down writing. It is respect for the reader's time.
- [OpenAI Codex skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills): skills package reusable instructions, resources, and optional scripts; plugins are the installable distribution path for reusable Codex workflows.
- [skills.sh docs](https://skills.sh/docs): open skills can also be discovered and installed through `npx skills add owner/repo`.

## About The Name

The name nods to Ditto from Pokemon: transformation without losing the original shape. Also, "ditto" is a perfectly normal English word, so please do not sue me, Nintendo. Dittobot is unofficial and unaffiliated.
