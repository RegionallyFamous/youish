# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add portable repo validation and GitHub Actions checks.
- Add `scripts/audit.py` for model-free audits of arbitrary source/rewrite pairs.
- Add `scripts/case_lab.py` to turn redacted rewrite failures into regression-case skeletons.
- Add `scripts/voice_probe.py` for local, model-free voice-signal extraction from writing samples.
- Add `scripts/live_report.py` for summarizing local live-eval transcripts by model, prompt mode, family, error type, and usage.
- Add stable failure codes and buckets across audit/live-eval reporting.
- Add profile-contract self-tests for same-source/different-profile behavior, profile fact leakage, evidence phrase overuse, and boundary overrides.
- Add reusable fact-fence and voice-profile-card references.
- Add package-file manifest sharing between install drift checks and repo validation.
- Add optional live model smoke testing with safer API URL and transcript handling.
- Make live eval reporting track attempted, passed, not-run, and usage totals instead of counting stopped cases as passes.
- Make live-eval saved transcripts hash-only by default, with explicit raw source/output opt-ins.
- Add install drift checks for copied or symlinked skill installs.
- Strengthen voice-profile guidance, emotional anti-flattening, and format preservation.
- Harden deterministic fixture validation for protected facts, modality drift, causality drift, invented details, preambles, and no-dash constraints.
- Add thought-dump default fixtures, source-only live-eval prompts, clarifying-question guards, wrapper detection, ordered-term checks, artifact cleanup checks, and paragraph/bullet constraints.
- Add live-eval case listing, prompt printing, and prompt-mode filtering so source-only thought-dump defaults can be inspected without API calls.
- Add live-eval fail-fast/max-failure controls, hard API setup error stops, richer transcript hashes, and `--no-save-source`.
- Add claim-level regression checks for polarity, required claims, forbidden assertions, and uncertainty preservation.
- Add bad-rewrite and regression-case issue templates, pull request checklist, contributor guide, security/privacy guidance, and release checklist.
